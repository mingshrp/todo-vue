## What I Enjoyed

I enjoyed using Vue because it is easy to manage. Breaking the todo app into self-contained components made everything feel organized. I also liked Vue using $emit to pass data between child and parent components, it felt clean once I understood how it worked.

## What I Disliked

I occasionally ran into issues where updating nested properties didn’t trigger updates like I expected but it was easy to see the problem and fix it. Other than that, there was nothing to dislike.
