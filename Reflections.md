## Why I Chose This Framework

I was stuck between React and Vue, but ultimately chose **Vue** because of its simplicity and ease of use. Its syntax is more similar to standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While React is often preferred for large-scale products, Vue is a perfect fit for a smaller project, such as this to-do app.
